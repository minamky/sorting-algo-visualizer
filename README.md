# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer
This Python application provides an interactive way to visualize and understand sorting algorithms. You can observe the behavior of various sorting algorithms in real time, including Quick Sort, Bubble Sort, and Insertion Sort.

## Features
Adjustable Speed: Control the speed of the sorting animation to slow down or speed up the visualization.

Dynamic Block Count: Change the number of blocks (bars) to be sorted, and see how different algorithms handle various data sizes.

Multiple Sorting Algorithms: Choose from Quick Sort, Bubble Sort, and Insertion Sort to visualize how each algorithm sorts the data.
